# hello-world
This is my firs repository in github. In the name of God.
My name is AliMohammad Rezazade & I want to be a programmer. I started programming about 10 years ago, but I stopped working. Because I didn't have anybody to guide. But I restarded just at last summer. I've learnt HTML, CSS & Javascript and want to create my programs & work. Somtimes I see it impossible, but I have to keep going to become a good developer. today is 28th of Aban 1398. I wish somday I come here when I'm a great developer.
Oh God!
